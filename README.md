# Satisfood

Satisfood is a website-based application that recommends your restaurant based on location, weather, and previous restaurant choice. Satisfood will detect weather condition to provide suitable food for the rainy season. This application uses a Machine Learning technique, namely Content Based Filtering which uses similarities in features to make decisions. Restaurants are sorted from most similar to least similar to the previous restaurant choice based on their cosine similarity.
